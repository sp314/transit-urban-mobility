Data is taken from [here](https://movement.uber.com/?lang=en-US) from the "Travel Times" dataset for Boston. We want to look at how different transit policies impact the travel times within a city.

Some possible events to look at:

* https://www.wbur.org/news/2015/10/07/mbta-announces-nonstop-commuter-rail-trips-between-worcester-and-boston

I simply found these looking at the "Service cuts and improvements" section of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_MBTA. We could also look at other things adjacent like fares or major events! Of course we're a bit restricted by the times we have in each city, but feel free to check out another city, another time, or another event/shock. The event doesn't need to be public transit related but it should have an effect on how people move around or make decisions around travel.
